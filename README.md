# monogame-with-physics---VR-and-non-VR
I tried using the repo here https://github.com/mattleibow/jitterphysics but it didn't work out of the box. so i rebuilt it in monogame 3.8 3.8.0.1641 but using the Jitter physics from the google archive here https://code.google.com/archive/p/jitterphysics/ .  It doesn't include the fixes of github user mattleibow yet on some jitter physics code. The Jitter physics is MIT license and the jitter physics license is written all over the scripts inside of the jitter.dll. The mattleibow repo is probably still working but somehow i wasn't able to make it work after a while anymore.
